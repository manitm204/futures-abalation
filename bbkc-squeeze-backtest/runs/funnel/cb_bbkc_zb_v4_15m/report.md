## Stage 9 -- DSR audit (diagnostic, not a gate)

- Return frequency: daily (all Sharpe, SR*, variance in per-period daily units; annualized x sqrt(252) for display)
- Trial-Sharpe variance (per period): 1.349e-03 over 3840 configs (every development backtest in the full grid (not survivors))
- Effective trials: Li-Ji 512.0, participation ratio 17.9, 95%-variance components 212 (rank bound T = 1250); raw grid 3840; raw + known prior 682896
- Primary method: li_ji; serial dependence: lag1_effective_n (AR(1) effective n); kurtosis passed as excess
- Calibration verified: **False** -> labels are `unverified` until reviewed

Unresolved:
- Effective-trial count is estimated from the eigen-spectrum of the full-grid development return correlation matrix; the estimate is bounded by the number of days (rank) and the choice of estimator (Li-Ji vs participation ratio) moves DSR materially.
- The earlier ICT Silver Bullet search has no recorded trial count, so it is not included in any trial total.
- Threshold changes across funnel_v1..v3 are additional researcher degrees of freedom not captured by a config count.
- Trial-Sharpe dispersion includes configs with very few trades, whose noisy Sharpe inflates the variance (and so the benchmark).

A candidate can be a research survivor (passes stages 1-7) without passing DSR; the two are reported separately.
ZN results are unchanged rules on the development period: supporting evidence, not an independent replication.

## Integrity audit

- Compression at bar k uses bars through k only: bbkc = 2 x population sd(close, L) < kc_mult x Wilder ATR(L) (Bollinger 2 sd inside a Keltner channel, both centred on SMA(L)); nr = the bar's high-low range is the narrowest of the last N bars (ties count), and with inside_bar also inside the previous bar's range. Indicators run over the RTH bar series across sessions.
- A run is a maximal stretch of consecutive compression bars inside one session (never continued across the open); its box through bar r is [min low, max high] of its bars up to r. The decision at bar k uses the run holding the last compression bar r <= k-1 of k's session, live when k - r <= setup_expiry_bars, the run is at least min_squeeze_bars long (NR: 1) and the box is at least min_box_atr x ATR(14)[r] wide, so the box never includes the decision bar. A box too narrow to be live never consumes its run.
- Breakout: close entries need close_k beyond the box and fill at the NEXT bar's open (market slippage); wick entries are a stop order at the box edge, filled on bar k at the worse of its open and the edge (stop slippage); a wick bar through both edges is ambiguous and not traded. The fill bar must be in the decision's session.
- The FIRST breakout of a run decides and consumes it, traded or not (wrong direction, trend filter, inside the last 30 minutes, a position already open, a missed entry). Each setup is one decision.
- Filters known at the decision: ema50 needs close > EMA(50) for a long / < for a short (close entries at bar k, wick entries at bar k-1); no decision on the session's last bar or less than 30 minutes before its last close.
- Stop = the far side of the box, or entry price -/+ k x ATR(14) using the ATR known before the fill bar; R = entry price (before slippage) to stop; target = entry +/- target_r x R. Stop and target are live intrabar from the entry bar; a bar touching both counts as the stop; on a wick entry's own bar only the stop is checked, and a touch there counts (conservative). Stops fill at the worse of open and stop, targets at the better of open and target (a gap through it), each with slippage.
- Every position still open on the session's last bar is closed at that bar's CLOSE (market-on-close with the same slippage); nothing is held overnight. Stop and target take precedence over the close.
- Long and short: P&L = side x (exit fill - entry fill) x quantity - commissions; sizing is the mean-reversion funnel's (as many whole contracts as equity covers at full contract value, unlevered, compounding).
- Development backtests run on data physically truncated at the development end; the final session's trade is closed at the last development bar and flagged forced (not counted as completed).
- Sharpe: daily session-close mark-to-market returns over every trading day (flat days = 0), sqrt(252) annualization, rf = 0, idle cash earns 0.
- Look-ahead truncation test: 40 sampled configs x 3 cut points, failures: 0

## Futures data and execution

- Data: Databento GLBX.MDP3 ohlcv-1m continuous front month by volume (<ROOT>.v.0), built by scripts/build_futures_data.py.
- Rolls: difference back-adjusted at each instrument change (Databento rolls at 00:00 UTC; the 1-minute step there is taken as the roll spread). Point moves are preserved; pre-roll price levels are not real traded prices.
- Session: each root's day session only (src/data/futures.py SESSIONS: NYSE 09:30-16:00 NY for equity indexes, 09:00-14:30 NY for crude, 08:20-13:30 NY for gold, 08:20-15:00 NY for FX; sessions under 5% of normal volume are skipped), on NYSE trading days; overnight Globex bars are not traded or used in indicators.
- Sizing: whole contracts, as many as equity covers at full contract value (unadjusted price x multiplier) -- unlevered, compounding. Quantities in the trade log are contracts x multiplier.
- Costs: slippage in ticks per side (stops too) plus commission per contract per side, from the execution YAML; cost stress scales both.
- Rolls happen outside the day session (Databento rolls at 00:00 UTC) and every position is flat by the session close, so no trade straddles a roll; compression, box, stop and target are all point distances, so back-adjustment does not change them.

## Unresolved assumptions

- Drawdown limit -30% is reused from the SPY funnels; it was not separately approved for unlevered futures sizing.
- Drawdown is measured on daily session-close mark-to-market; intraday drawdown is deeper.
- rf = 0 and idle cash earns 0. Unlevered futures sit mostly in cash (T-bill interest in reality), so returns vs. a real account are understated in high-rate years while Sharpe vs. cash is unaffected by that choice.
- Variable cost stress scales per-contract commission and slippage ticks together.
- Trades are attributed to the year/window of their entry session; a position open at the development end is force-closed and excluded from completed-trade counts.
- Whole-contract granularity: at ~$1M equity the position is a handful of ES contracts, so position size steps with price; results are sensitive to starting equity at small sizes.
- All lengths (BB/KC length, NR-N, ATR(14), EMA(50), min squeeze bars, setup expiry) count bars of the config's timeframe and run across sessions over RTH bars only, so the overnight gap enters the first bars of each session: it widens sd and ATR there (bbkc) and can make the first bar's range look normal (nr). Runs and boxes themselves never span sessions.
- Bar data cannot order events inside a bar: a stop and a target in the same bar count as the stop, and a wick entry's own bar checks only the stop. Both choices are conservative; a target is never credited on the entry bar of a wick entry even when it was reached after the fill.
- Targets fill as if they were market orders at the target (with slippage), not as resting limits that may or may not be filled at the touch.
- Sizing ignores the stop distance (full equity per trade, as in the other families), so the box stop and the ATR stops change the exit, not the position size.
- Squeeze (BB inside KC) and NR-N are separate strategy lines with their own runs; a breakout is never compared across lines inside one run, so stage-6 dedup does not merge a squeeze config with an NR config that trades the same days.
